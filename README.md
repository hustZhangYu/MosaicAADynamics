# Mosaic AA Dynamics
 We study the dynamics of mosaic AA model and construct the effective Hamiltonian.

 ## Numerical results
 In this part, we show the codes which are used to take the numerical simulations.  
 The main numerical study contains wavepacket dynamics and particle distributiom.
 ### Wavepacket dynamics
 Time evolutionn of wavepacket 

 Time evolution of $\langle x^2 \rangle$

 ### Particle number distribution
Imbalance

Particle distribution 

 ## Effective Hamiltonian

 ### spectrum and IPR for eigenvalues

 ### finitie size scaling

 ## Reply codes
 Some codes to reply the questions of referees.
