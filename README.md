# Mosaic AA Dynamics
 We study the dynamics of mosaic AA model and construct the effective Hamiltonian.

 ## Numerical results
 In this part, we show the codes which are used to take the numerical simulations.  
 We will show some properties of the mosaic AA model. 
 The main numerical study also contains wavepacket dynamics and particle distributiom.
### Mosaic AA model 

Mobility edge

ExtendeProportion.

 ### Wavepacket dynamics
 Time evolutionn of wavepacket 
 
 Time evolution of $\langle x^2 \rangle$
 ### Particle number distribution
Imbalance

Particle distribution 

 ## Effective Hamiltonian

 ### spectrum and IPR for eigenvalues

 ### finitie size scaling
